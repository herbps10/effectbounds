Description: Non-parametric estimators of non-overlap bounds of causal effects, providing asymptotically valid bounds even when overlap (also known as positivity) does not hold. Uncertainty intervals robust to lack of covariate overlap are estimated using a multiplier bootstrap technique. Ensemble methods are used to estimate propensity score and outcome models.
