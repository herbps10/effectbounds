## Overview

The `effectbounds` package provides tools for estimating non-overlap bounds for causal effects.

The identification of causal effects typically relies on the _overlap assumption_ (also known as _positivity_), which requires that all units have a positive probability of being in either the treatment or control group. 

When overlap fails in finite-samples, with some units having very small estimated probability of receiving the treatment (or control), then estimators of the causal effect can perform poorly. 

Non-overlap bounds are an approach for estimating causal effects even when non-overlap is violated, by focusing on estimating _bounds_ on the effect.

## Installation

You can install the development version of effectbounds from [GitHub](https://github.com/herbps10/effectbounds):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("herbps10/effectbounds")
```

## Example
The example estimates uniform 95% non-overlap bounds for the ATE using simulated data.

```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
library(effectbounds)

dat <- simulate_ate_example(seed = 1, N = 5e2, alpha = 3, beta = 0.1, gamma = 1)

bounds <- bounds_ate(
  dat, 
  X = c("X1", "X2"), A = "A", Y = "Y", 
  thresholds = c(10^seq(-3, -0.5, 0.1)), 
  smoothness = c(0.005)
)

plot(bounds, point_estimate = TRUE, main = "Non-overlap ATE Bounds")
```

The plot shows the non-overlap bounds (the black points) on the ATE axis for a range of _propensity score thresholds_. bounds are _uniform 95% confidence intervals_: this means you can pick any of the intervals, for any choice of threshold, and interpret it as a valid 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ATE.

The plot also shows a point estimate (the blue dot) and 95% CI (the blue line) for the ATE. The non-overlap bounds are, for the right choice of threshold, _shorter_ than the 95% CI for the ATE point estimate.
